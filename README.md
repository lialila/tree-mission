# Tree.ly Coding Assignment

Implement an example section of a website as a React Component. You can find
the Figma prototype of the section
[here](https://www.figma.com/file/VtZfQgG19WyU7RJiYwTljD/Application-Task?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=bQ89KmZZEbD1MXAj-1)
â€“ the assets and fonts you need should lie next to this file.

## Requirements

- Please deliver the section as a React component embedded in a small project.
- The project can be delivered as a link to a Git repository or as a ZIP file.
- Feel free to use any React framework you are familiar with (Next.js, Gatsby,
  ...). We are using Next.js.
- The section should be responsive.
- Any React component should include tests as well as Storybook stories.
- Feel free to use any component library. We are using
  [Boemly](https://boemly.tree.ly/). Keep in mind that your section should look
